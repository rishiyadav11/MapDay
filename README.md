# MapDay

**MapDay** is a full-stack web application designed to help users plan and organize their YouTube video watchlist on a daily basis. The app allows users to add YouTube videos to their list, view them later, and mark them as completed once watched. It also provides a thumbnail preview for each video link, making it easy to identify the content at a glance.

## Features

### 1. **Daily Video Organization**
   - Users can categorize their YouTube videos by the date they plan to watch them.
   - The app displays all videos under the respective date, making it easy to manage your daily watchlist.

### 2. **Real-Time YouTube Thumbnail Fetching**
   - As users input a YouTube link, the app automatically fetches and displays the videoâ€™s thumbnail in real-time.
   - This feature ensures that users can visually identify the content of the video before adding it to their list.

### 3. **Task Management**
   - Users can mark videos as "Complete" after watching them.
   - Completed videos are highlighted in green, while pending videos are highlighted in red, providing a clear visual distinction between completed and pending tasks.

### 4. **Interactive User Interface**
   - The app features a collapsible sidebar that includes a form for adding new videos. The sidebar can be expanded or collapsed as needed.
   - The main dashboard displays the list of videos categorized by date, allowing users to see all their tasks at a glance.

### 5. **Confirmation Dialog for Video Playback**
   - Before playing a video, a confirmation dialog asks the user if they want to watch it now. This helps in prioritizing tasks and ensuring that the user is ready to engage with the content.

### 6. **Video Removal**
   - Users can easily remove videos from their list if they no longer wish to watch them. This keeps the dashboard clean and focused on relevant tasks.

### 7. **Responsive Design**
   - The user interface is built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring that the app is responsive and looks good on all screen sizes.
